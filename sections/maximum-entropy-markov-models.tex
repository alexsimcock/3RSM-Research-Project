Some development on the hidden Markov model was made by the MEMM \autocite{mccallum-2000-maximum}.

\subfile{tikz-figures/memm-diagram}

This model presumes $X$ is generated first and that each new label $Y_i$, generates based on the observations $X_{1:i}$ and states $Y_{1:i-1}$.

As such we run into label bias as early tags will take no heed of later observations, hence not leveraging the full context - much like the HMM.
